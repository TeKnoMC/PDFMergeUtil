# PDFMergeUtil
A python program designed to take a directory of PDFs and merge them into one output file (concatenated in alphabetical order).

## Example usage
`$ python pdfmerge.py -i /path/to/input/directory -o /path/to/output/file.pdf`

Running it with no parameters (as follows) uses the current working directory, and outputs to `output.pdf`.
`$ python pdfmerge.py`
